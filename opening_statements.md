3. Third, it is an app to vastly increase the amount of Cherokee speech and text on the internet

Large Language Models (LLMs) learn languages the same way as human children. Sequoyah, the great giver of Cherokee text laid the groundwork for LLMs today to begin to read and understand Cherokee. Now, in the age of LLMs we can do something amazing. Surely this idea will evolve, however now i have a few ideas in mind. 

1. CherokeeLLM Speaking Companion: trained on Sequoya's books and poems that can recite stories, and use OpenAI whisper or OpenAI whisper adjacent tools to serve as a speaking companion -- can converse etc with the user, like an Elder. Reciting Cherokee stories, also giving the user a modern use case for the language. Encouraging them to great music, poems, films in Cherokee. Give people the ability to learn, preserve, grow this language. This is the speaking companion. 
2. Multi-Agent Cherokee Text debate sandbox. CherokeeLLM AutoGPT, MemGPT, Autogen, multi-agent group-chat sandbox. This is a longer term moon shot project to increase the amount of valid Cherokee on the internet by over 100 times or more. Multi-agent means multiple Cherokee Text LLMs with different interests, backgrounds, and points of view engaging in conversation, debate, poetry, authorship, etc. It will take experts to understand if the outputs are valid (valid as in correct Cherokee, also culturally in the correct ballpark, trained with a lower temperature on Cherokee stories, perhaps reciting them verbatim, then talking through the concepts together.)
3. Cherokee_Elder_GPT -- compile stories from Cherokee elders and train the model to be the ultimate Elder. The keeper of stories, the grower of language. 
4. An interactive farming game that interacts with you in Cherokee language, such that you learn words for the land, things Cherokee's based their language on, in an immersive (perhaps even AR/VR environment). I'm imagining an open-world game -- even like Red Dead Redemption, where you walk around, farm, ride, hunt, fish, speak, listen, and write. Imagine if there were a peaceful place you could go in a virtual world to be immersed in the culture 
5. An actual Middlebury-style (or Middlebury-actual) language school for Cherokee. A school program with a language pledge meant for adults to go for 6-8 weeks and become fluent in a summer. Use scholarship money and do it during a time when its nice to be in Talequah. 
6. Straight up what i want here -- documentaries only in Cherokee 
7. Ah, technology to auto-recognize cherokee and produce subtitles in Syllabary -- check if this exists, but would be great contribution 
8. A little ambitious, but perhaps a new type of writing system, or aid to the current Phonetics-Syllabary-English trio 
9. Cherokee freestyle rap, slam poetry, music, lofi, documentary films
